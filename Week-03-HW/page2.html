                “Ways of Seeing”
            </a> 
            <p>
                is a documentary by John Berger. He discusses the evolution of the medium of art and how our capabilities of capturing and reproducing art has changed in recent years.  Berger claims that the reproduction of paintings and art changes the value of it as well as separates the context of the piece from when it was created. A main topic Berger touches upon is the concept of how the way a person views art changes the way they perceive art. 
                <br><br>The way that one views art changes their perception of art. This has many meanings. Looking through different “lenses”, looking through different contexts, looking with a personal frame of reference, or looking at an altered view of the art. Berger talks about the fact that art can easily be altered and manipulated, which would change the meaning of the work. The meaning could change by directly altering the piece, adding music or rhythm, or even viewing additional materials.
                <br><br><span>Personally,</span> I think what Berger said in the documentary holds merit today to some extent. I do think that the reproducibility of art was largely a good thing for accessibility. I also think that everyone should be able to have their own conclusions when they view art, as everyone perceives things differently. However, I do agree that perception can be manipulated easily. Especially in the modern society of social media, there is a lot of faked media going around. It’s important to “be skeptical”.
